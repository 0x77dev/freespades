These paks are not included in the source tree because they contains some 
non-opensource materials and they seem too large to include in the git tree.

You can get the Japanese font pak from:

http://yvt.jp/files/programs/osppaks/font-mplus-ja.pak

This was converted from the M+ BDF font like this:

	./BdfToOSFont ../../Resources/Gfx/Fonts/MPlus10Font double < \
	~/Downloads/mplus_bitmap_fonts-2.2.4/fonts_j/mplus_j10r.bdf

Note that you need to install a input method editor, or use Google Translator 
or whatever to type Japanese characters.
